Project containing the implementation of two priority queues: heap and Fibonacci heap. The purpose of the project was to conduct research on the duration of the following operations:
- insert(e,p)
- extract-max()
- find-max()
- modify-key(e,p)
- return-size.

To carry out the above-mentioned research, it was necessary to implement functions for measuring time and generating search numbers.
